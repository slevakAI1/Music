You bit my lip
I'm a marked man
I don't really understand
How it seems like I've known you all my life/for so long

You took me out
In your new truck
Got a flat while mudding
It's just my luck

Shopping for art
....

Chorus:
....
Doing donuts in my yard  (last line of chorus)


=======================================

From ai:

**Verse 1**
Met her at the Quick Stop, boots on the dash,
Sun-faded ball cap, lipstick like flash.
Sweet as a peach pie, wild as a fire,
Kissed me like heaven, stared through me like wire.
Says, “Boy, you’re mine,” with a grin that ain’t playin’,
Prays for my heart then checks who I’m textin’.

**Verse 2**
She don’t do “maybe,” she don’t do “space,”
She’ll love you hard, then read your face.
If a waitress smiles, Gina’s eyes go cold,
Like a storm rollin’ in on a county road.
But she’ll ride shotgun through the worst of my days,
Hands on my neck like she’s sayin’ “I’ll stay.”

**Verse 3**
Then one bad Tuesday, I was dumb and late,
She saw that old friend’s name on my gate.
Next thing I know, headlights in the dark,
Engine revvin’ like a chainsaw spark.
She cut donuts in my front yard grass,
Left tire tracks like a heartbreak map.

**Chorus**
Oh Gina, you’re sweet but you’re dangerous,
Love me like a hymn, then you tear it up faithless.
Jealous like lightning, loyal like Sunday,
Kiss me, cuss me, call me “baby” the same way.
Yeah, my heart’s your home and my peace is gone—
Gina, girl, you’re trouble with the headlights on.
