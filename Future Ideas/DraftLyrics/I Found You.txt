Until I found you                              8 beats syncopated     - this borrows 1/8 note from prior bar
I didn't really know myself                    8 beats
I spent my time chasin' somethin' else.        8 beats
---- no 4th line - just music this bar         8 beats

Yeah you spoke my name                          8 beats
Like it wasn’t something wrong                 8 beats
Now my past is just a road to                  8 beats syncopated
. . where we both belong.                      8 beats


When I'm with you
I see the pos-i-bil-i-ties in
everything I couldn't do

Until I found you
I was really kinda lost
