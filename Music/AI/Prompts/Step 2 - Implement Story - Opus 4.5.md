Goal: To implement Story 4.2 from the Current Epic CurrentEpic_HumanDrummer.md.

Steps to achieve the goal:

(1) Review the details and acceptance criteria outlined in PreAnalysis_4.2.md to understand the basic requirements for Story 4.2.
(2) Compute answers to the Clarifying Questions in PreAnalysis_4.2.md and update this document with answers to be placed under each existing question (example: Question 1, newline, Answer 1 newline, ....).
(3) Implement (code) Story 4.2 from CurrentEpic_HumanDrummer.md including unit tests.
Use PreAnalysis_4.2.md to guide your implementation.
(4) Run the entire test suite to ensure no existing functionality is broken.
(5) Update ProjectArchitecture.md to reflect the changes. Only include project architecuture-related content.

WHAT NOT TO DO:
    - Do not update nor attempt to update CurrentEpic_HumanDrummer.md. The user will handle that.
