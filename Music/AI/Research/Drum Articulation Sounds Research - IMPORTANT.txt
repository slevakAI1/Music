Regarding digital music midi.

Can these percussion sounds be accurately played via midi? It would be using the channel (9 or 10?) drum set/drum kit which uses different pitch values to select the percussion instrument:

// AI: purpose=Enum for drum articulation hints; used by operators to specify desired playing technique.
// AI: invariants=Values are stable; None is default; mapped to MIDI note variations by DrumArticulationMapper (Story 6.3).
// AI: deps=Consumed by DrumCandidate; mapped by DrumArticulationMapper to MIDI notes.
// AI: change=Story 2.2; extend with additional articulations as needed (e.g., BrushSwirl, MalletHit).

Thought for 16s
Yes-ish, but only some of these are “accurately playable” in plain GM drum MIDI, and “accurate” depends heavily on what drum instrument you’re driving (GM module vs a modern drum VST with multiple articulations).

Channel 9 or 10?
In MIDI spec terms (1–16), drums are traditionally on Channel 10.

In many code/APIs that use 0–15 indexing, that’s channel 9.
So you’re both right depending on whether it’s 1-based or 0-based.

How well each articulation survives “GM drum notes only”
✅ SideStick
Works well in General MIDI.

Standard mapping: Note 37 = Side Stick.

✅ OpenHat
Works well in GM if you’re okay with the usual hi-hat limitations.

Typical GM notes:

46 = Open Hi-Hat

(for context: 42 = Closed, 44 = Pedal)

✅ Crash
Works well in GM.

Typical: 49 = Crash Cymbal 1 (and often 57 = Crash Cymbal 2)

✅ Ride / RideBell
Works well in GM.

Typical:

51 = Ride Cymbal 1

53 = Ride Bell

The ones that are not reliably “accurate” in plain GM
⚠️ Rimshot
GM does not have a universally-agreed “rimshot” note separate from snare.

Many devices fake it via:

a different snare note (often 40 = Electric Snare) used as “rimshot-ish”

velocity switching inside a drum VST (same note, higher velocity triggers rim sample)

keyswitch/articulation mapping specific to the library

Bottom line: you can map something, but it won’t be portable or guaranteed correct across drum kits.

⚠️ CrashChoke
GM has no standard “choked crash” note/articulation.

Some drum engines support choke by:

putting cymbals in a mute group (hit crash, then another note mutes it)

using Note-Off behavior (release stops sample) — not common for GM-style one-shots

a dedicated choke articulation note (library-specific)

Bottom line: not accurately representable as a single GM note across instruments.

⚠️ Flam
MIDI doesn’t have “play a flam” as a standard drum articulation.

You do it by programming two hits: a very short grace note before the main hit (often 10–40 ms depending on tempo/style), usually with the grace note lower velocity.

Some drum plugins offer a flam articulation, but again library-specific.

Practical recommendation
If your goal is GM-compatible MIDI that sounds reasonable everywhere:

Treat these as note selections: SideStick/OpenHat/Crash/Ride/RideBell ✅

Treat Rimshot/CrashChoke/Flam as performance constructs:

Rimshot: pick a “rimshot proxy note” in your target kit (or velocity rules)

CrashChoke: implement “hit + mute” logic per kit

Flam: emit 2 notes with timing/velocity shaping

If you tell me what drum target you’re using (GM synth? Roland module? Superior Drummer / EZD / Addictive Drums / Kontakt library?), I can give you a concrete note map and the best way to implement choke/flam for that specific engine.
