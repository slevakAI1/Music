Yes, many advanced drum VST plugins (Virtual Studio Technology) are specifically designed to handle complex articulations like rimshots, stick clicks, and positional data, going far beyond what basic MIDI can do by using multiple samples, velocity layers, and MIDI CC (Control Change) messages, with popular options including Toontrack Superior Drummer 3, BFD3, Addictive Drums 2, and specialized free ones like SSD5 Free and BFD Player, providing nuanced sounds for rimshots (center vs. edge) and more realistic percussion. 
How They Work Beyond Basic MIDI
Velocity Layers: Instead of just loud/soft (velocity 0-127), they trigger different samples for the same note (e.g., rimshot, cross-stick, center hit) based on how hard you hit the virtual pad (MIDI velocity) or specific MIDI notes/CCs.
MIDI CC & Positional Sensing: Plugins like Superior Drummer 3 (SD3) and BFD3 support MIDI CC messages (like CC4 for hi-hat control) and positional sensing, allowing e-drum pads to send data about where on the head/rim you hit, triggering different sounds (e.g., rimshot on the rim vs. center).
Multiple Articulations: They include separate sounds for rimshots (shallow/edge, deep/center), stick clicks (on toms/kick), open/closed hi-hats with foot splashes, cymbal chokes, and more. 
Popular & Recommended Drum VSTs
Toontrack Superior Drummer 3 (SD3) & EZdrummer 3: Powerhouses with extensive articulations, layering, and mapping for e-drums (SD3 is very deep).
BFD3 (FXpansion): Known for deep customization, less processed sounds, and excellent e-drum support.
Addictive Drums 2 (AD2): User-friendly with great sounds and articulations, good for various genres.
Steven Slate Drums 5 (SSD5): Offers the free SSD5 Free version with basic kits and articulations, plus paid expansions.
GGD (GetGood Drums) & Mixwave: Popular for modern metal/rock, offering detailed articulation maps. 
How to Find Rimshots & More
Check Articulation Maps: Look for plugins that mention "X-Hats," "Rimshots," "Side Sticks," "Stick Clicks," "Chokes," or "Positional Sensing" in their features.
Use MIDI Mapping: In your DAW, map specific MIDI notes or CCs to trigger these articulations within the plugin.
E-Drum Integration: For the best results, use with e-drum kits that send positional data (like Roland's PD-140DS) to trigger sounds accurately.
