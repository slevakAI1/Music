You said:
I whistled a tune and saved as m4a file. Is there a way to convert that to music notes?
Any format would be good, but something simple like listing each note/rest as list of midi pitch and note durations would be fine. Music notation even better, whatever you can do within your limits. If you can't do this, let me know if there are any free programs for windows 11 that can.

Yes — you can convert your whistled M4A audio file into music notes, but because audio → notation is a non-trivial signal-processing problem, you’ll typically use a two-step workflow:

Convert the audio to MIDI (extract pitch + timing).

Open that MIDI in notation software to get readable music notation (or a list of pitches + durations).

🎶 Easiest Way (No Coding)
1) Online Audio → MIDI Converters
These tools take your file (WAV/MP3/M4A) and give you a MIDI file you can edit:

Spotify Basic Pitch (free online) — simple drag-and-drop audio to MIDI (open-source) 

Samplab Audio to MIDI — web/desktop converter that outputs MIDI from audio. 

AI-MIDI.com — free audio → MIDI conversion in browser. 

Singify Audio to MIDI — free online tool that can convert M4A straight to MIDI. 

Songscription.ai — can generate sheet music, piano roll, tabs, MusicXML, or MIDI from audio. 

Pros: no install, quick results
Cons: accuracy varies — whistling is easier than complex music, but timing/pitch errors can still appear.

2) Open the MIDI in Notation Software
Once you have a MIDI file:

MuseScore (free for Windows 11) — popular free notation editor. You can open MIDI and it will show the notes as sheet music.

You can export MusicXML, PDF, ABC, etc.

It’s not automatic pitch quoting from audio — but after MIDI conversion it works great.
(Conversion step still needed.)

Midify (Microsoft Store) — lets you edit and tweak MIDI files and see notation on Windows. 

Other: Any DAW (Reaper, Cakewalk) can open MIDI, but MuseScore is the best free choice for notation.

💻 Free Windows-Friendly Workflow (Step-by-Step)
Convert M4A to WAV (optional but can help):

Use a free audio converter (e.g., MediaHuman Audio Converter). 

Upload to an online audio-to-MIDI tool (Basic Pitch / AI-MIDI / Samplab / Singify).

Download the MIDI file.

Open MIDI in MuseScore:

View as sheet music.

Export as MusicXML, PDF, or plain MIDI note list.

📌 Notes & Limitations
Automatic audio transcription is not perfect. Algorithms are good for monophonic signals (like a whistle), but still make mistakes — especially with timing and fast ornaments. That’s just how current tech works. 

If your tune is monophonic (only one note at a time, like a whistle), most of these work pretty well. If it’s polyphonic or noisy, results deteriorate.

There aren’t many truly free* end-to-end audio-to-notation apps that work perfectly — most good ones either use online services or cost money.

🧠 Bonus: If You Want a Programmable/Scripted Route
You can write code using libraries like Basic Pitch (Spotify) or Python MIR libraries like madmom / Partitura — but that requires coding. 

🍭 Output Options You Can Get
Output Type	How to Get It
MIDI file	Online audio → MIDI converters
Sheet music (notation)	MIDI → MuseScore
MusicXML (standard)	MIDI → MuseScore export
Pitch + durations text	Parse MIDI file (DAW or script)
If you want, I can help you with the actual conversion or MIDI output structure:
Just upload the M4A file here and I’ll process it and return a note list or basic MIDI representation.
