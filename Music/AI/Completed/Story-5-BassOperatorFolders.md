# Story 5: Replace drum-copied bass operator/candidate stubs with bass-named counterparts

## Summary
- Added bass operator-family folders (`MicroAddition`, `SubdivisionTransform`, `PhrasePunctuation`, `PatternSubstitution`, `StyleIdiom`, `NoteRemoval`) with `.gitkeep` placeholders.
- Verified bass operator files contain no drum namespace references.

## Tests
- `dotnet build`
