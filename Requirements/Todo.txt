Next: (1) add something to writeform to show that the status of the score..like a score report..something simple, but enough to show
            the score is new or updated with recent action(s).
      (2) add a button that writes the music xml direct to musicxmlscore file / one - click
      (3) fix issue with 32nd notes
      (4) figure out what tests we need and update the current ones

Note: don't just simulate parts, simulate the artists - style, personality, etc.


Note: best Strategy to build music may be start with 32nd note rests filling all measures, then combine/replace
as needed.
Also sections do not really need to start on beat 1 of measure. Should be more fluid. Like start or 
end beat can be off +/- 1 beat.
